The Agency is accelerating the digital services agenda and the ITB will be facilitating the implementation
of this agenda. Given ITB is currently working on its existing workload, ie, transforming various IT
systems, creating new applications/programs, enhancing existing systems and databases, assessing
current processes and creating strategies to govern the Tax systems, additional resources are needed to
implement these new services/programs.
